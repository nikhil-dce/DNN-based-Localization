# Updates

### 27th March
Ankit - Added primitive model definition.
+ Running `model.py` saves the graph in folder `events_summary`.
+ Currently uses placeholder for input data to infer the correct shape.
+ `train_multigpu.py` is currently under progress. Would change it once data loading pipeline is fixed.
